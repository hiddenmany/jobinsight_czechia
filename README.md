### ⚠️ Current System Status & Root Cause Analysis (2026-01-06)
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - All data quality issues have been fixed.

**Technical Findings for Correction:**
- ✅ **Salary Parsing Bug (`parsers.py`):** Fixed. Global k-suffix handling on line 32.
- ✅ **Scraper Contention (`scraper.py`):** Fixed. Tech scrapers run sequentially in Batch 2.
- ✅ **Classification Bias (`classifiers.py`):** Fixed. Tech leads now classified as Developer.

**Resolution Roadmap:**
1. ✅ **Reproduced:** Verified failures in `test_scraper_fixes.py` (Salary coverage: StartupJobs 51% vs WTTJ 0%).
2. ✅ **Action Taken:** Refactored `SalaryParser.parse` to detect and multiply shorthand values (n < 1000) for all tech sources.
3. ✅ **Action Taken:** Updated `scraper.py:main()` to run tech-focused scrapers sequentially before high-volume ones.

## 📈 Dual-Median Methodology

This project provides **two distinct salary metrics** to serve different analytical needs:

### 1. Professional Median (81,250 CZK)
**Target Audience:** HR professionals, tech recruiters, and white-collar job seekers

**Included Roles:**
- Developer, Analyst, Management, PM, Sales, HR
- Marketing, Designer, QA, Finance, Legal
- Education, Technical Specialists, Electromechanics

**Purpose:** Reflects the actual compensation landscape for skilled professional roles. This is the metric most relevant for tech hiring, salary benchmarking, and competitive analysis in professional services.

### 2. National Estimated Median (31,421 CZK)
**Target Audience:** Economists, policy researchers, national labor market analysis

**Methodology:** Approximates the Czech Statistical Office (ČSÚ) approach:
- **Filters for Full-Time Employment (HPP)** only
- **Excludes:**
  - Part-time workers (Brigáda, DPP, DPČ)
  - Contractors and self-employed (IČO, OSVČ, Fakturace, Živnost)

**Important Context:**
- This metric shows the **advertised floor salary** in job postings
- ČSÚ's official median (~41,000 CZK) reflects **actual paid wages** including bonuses, overtime, and benefits
- The ~10,000 CZK gap is expected because:
  1. Job ads typically show base salary ranges (minimum guarantees)
  2. Actual compensation includes variable pay not advertised upfront
  3. Our data captures "entry offers" rather than "settled wages"

**Why Two Medians?**
- **For HR Strategy:** Use Professional Median to stay competitive in skilled labor markets
- **For Economic Research:** Use National Median to understand broad labor market trends
- **For Policy Analysis:** Compare both to understand the professional vs. general labor market gap
