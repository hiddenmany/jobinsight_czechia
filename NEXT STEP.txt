Option 1: Acknowledge Limitations (Honest Approach) Add disclaimer to reports: ⚠️ IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS This analysis measures DEMAND SIGNALS (what employers post), NOT MARKET REALITY (what actually gets hired/paid). Known Biases: - Ghost jobs: Estimated 10-30% of postings never filled - Requirements inflation: "Senior" roles often hire "Mid" - Salary ranges: Top of range rarely paid - Duplicate postings: Same job reposted multiple times USE THIS DATA FOR: ✅ Trending skills/technologies (demand signal) ✅ Relative comparisons (Python vs Java demand) ✅ Geographic distribution patterns DO NOT USE FOR: ❌ Exact salary expectations ❌ "Guaranteed" hiring probability ❌ Precise market sizing Option 2: Add Reality Filters (Improve Analysis) Detect and flag ghost jobs: # In analyzer.py - add ghost job detection def detect_ghost_jobs(self): """Identify likely ghost jobs""" ghost_indicators = [] # 1. Same job posted 5+ times by same company # 2. Unrealistic skill combinations (15+ requirements) # 3. Salary range > 100% width # 4. Description contains "ideal candidate" language return ghost_indicators # Flag in reports: "⚠️ 15 potential ghost jobs detected" Option 3: Track "Fill Rate" (Advanced) Re-scrape after 30 days and check: - Still posted? → Likely ghost job - Disappeared? → Might have been filled Option 4: Comparative Analysis (More Honest) Instead of "Average salary is X", show: Salary Ranges Posted: - 25th percentile: 40,000 CZK (more realistic floor) - Median: 60,000 CZK - 75th percentile: 80,000 CZK - Posted maximum: 120,000 CZK (aspirational) Reality: Most hires likely happen at 40-70k range, not the posted maximums. --- 🎯 My Recommendation Implement ALL of these: 1. Add prominent disclaimer about limitations 2. Detect and flag ghost jobs (20+ duplicates found!) 3. Show percentiles instead of just averages 4. Track posting age (older = more likely ghost) 5. Rename metrics: - "Average Salary" → "Advertised Salary Range" - "Jobs Requiring Python" → "Jobs Mentioning Python" - "Market Demand" → "Posted Demand Signal" This makes the analysis honest and still useful - it's a demand signal tracker, not a guarantee of reality.
